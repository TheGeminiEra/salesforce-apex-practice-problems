# #16 - Sum 1 to N

Implement the method <code>sumToN</code> that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers (inclusive) from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. Assume that <code>n</code> will be non-zero positive integer.

<code>sumToN(5) = 15</code></br>

<code>sumToN(2) = 3</code>

## Hint 1
You can use a for loop to loop through integers <code>1</code> through <code>n</code>, and keep adding them to a variable.

## Hint 2
You may remember a different approach from a Math class: there is a very simple formula to calculate the sum of the first <code>n</code> Natural Numbers.
