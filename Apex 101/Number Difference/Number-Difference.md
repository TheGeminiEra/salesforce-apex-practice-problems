# #4 - Number Difference

Implement a function <code>diff</code> that calculates the absolute difference between two integers.

<code>diff(5, 2) = 3</code>

<code>diff(2, 5) = 3</code>

## Hint 1
One approach is to use an if statement with a comparison operator to determine which Integer is the larger integer. Then, subtract the smaller integer from the larger integer.

## Hint 2
You may also use the <code>Math.abs</code> function to calculate the absolute value of a number. Subtract one number from the other, and use <code>Math.abs</code> to calculate the absolute value.
